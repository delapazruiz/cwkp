For the purpose of synthesizing a compendium of efforts aimed at environmental pollution control through the use of constructed wetlands systems (CWs) in Ireland, a detailed review of CWs was undertaken. Emphasis was placed on the diverse range of development, practice and researches on CWs technology, placing them in the overall context of the need for low-cost and sustainable wastewater treatment systems.

The main differences are that the guidelines are much broader than the German guidelines, which could be due to the fact that the national guidelines in the US have to be adapted into laws by the federal states, tribal authorities and regional offices (2).

       		• Guidelines and Standards for Wastewater Reuse. Keywords: Wastewater reuse, Guidelines, Regulations, Standards. Due to water shortage, wastewater reuse has gained great importance in many parts
     of the world. Wastewater reuse practices have become valuable source in water
     resources management. As an independent source of water, reclaimed water can
     increase the reliability of water supply. Reclaimed wastewater requires effective
     measures to protect public health and the environment. Strong wastewater reuse
     guidelines and regulations are developed for the purpose. It is difficult to establish
     wastewater guidelines and regulations that can suit all regions in the world. Among
     the broad reasons for this as limiting factors, are economics of countries relating
     chosen treatment technologies and additionally, the local context of a region must be
     taken into consideration in settings. Almost all wastewater reuse guidelines and
     regulations are bacteriological-based. Some of them consider biochemical
     parameters.

     objectives of a treated wastewater reuse policy and the existing barriers and constraints which
     will have to be overcome if wastewater reuse strategies are meant to gather more momentum
     and be adopted on a larger and more effective scale than at present. It is the first step for
     collecting information on the current status of wastewater reuse in the European Union (EU)

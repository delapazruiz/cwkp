Advancing a Nexus Approach to the sustainable management of environmental resources

<strong><p class="generic">Dear Sir or Madam,
</p></strong>

<p class="generic"> We would like to thank you very much for your interest in our project. Currently, we are
implementing a global online database and map application about Constructed Wetlands.
With the next information, we would like to provide an overview to you and explain what this
project is about.

              <p class="generic">Globally, human and environmental health is endangered in many areas. In 2015, approx. <strong>2.4 billion
              people</strong> were still using unimproved sanitation facilities. Moreover, sources estimate that around
              <strong>80% of all wastewater worldwide</strong> is released untreated into the environment, leading to
              deteriorating water quality. The international community seeks to achieve <strong>universal access</strong> to
              adequate and equitable sanitation as well as to improve water quality by <strong>halving the proportion</strong> of
              untreated wastewater and increasing its safe reuse (targets 6.2 and 6.3 of the Agenda 2030).
              Constructed Wetlands (CWs) are nature-based solutions which can contribute to achieve the
              sustainable development goals, but it remains unclear to which extent, as, currently, there is no
              knowledge about the contribution of constructed wetland systems, e.g. to the global amount of
              treated wastewater. Moreover, several studies claimed limited data availability in the recent past.</p>

              <p class="generic">  The United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of
                Resources (UNU-FLORES) likes to create <strong>one central platform</strong> about Constructed Wetlands worldwide,
                consisting of a comprehensive database, including system properties and performance parameters of
                CWs, and a visual interface representing their geographic distribution through a WebGIS. Additional
                features may (eventually) include data manipulation, upload and download functions. The aim is to
                <strong>assess the amount of wastewater that is treated globally by constructed wetland systems.</strong>

                Moreover, UNU-FLORES wishes to <strong>support scientists, representatives of international organizations,
                implementers, funding bodies, further experts and the public on a long-term basis</strong>, e.g. in CW
                research, policy-making, financing, implementation, and operation.</p>

              The project work will begin with a <strong>comprehensive review of existing databases and literature</strong> about
              Constructed Wetlands, to gain an overview of available data which might be useful for suggesting
              potential database variables to stakeholders. This comprehensive review includes a special emphasis
              on sludge drying reed beds. Meanwhile, a <strong>short preliminary survey</strong> will be sent out to the experts
              willing to collaborate. Then, the <strong>stakeholder survey</strong> will be designed based on the comprehensive
              literature review as well as the responses to the short preliminary survey. After the first internal
              feedback round, the experts will also be asked about their <strong>feedback regarding the draft stakeholder
              survey.</strong> Their remarks will be considered for the preparation of the final stakeholder survey, which
              will be widely made available to cooperating experts, to stakeholders and networks that have been
              mentioned in the responses to the pre-survey, as well as through other communication channels.

<strong><p class="generic">Dear Sir or Madam,
</p></strong>

<p class="generic"> We would like to thank you very much for your interest in our project. Currently, we are
implementing a global online database and map application about Constructed Wetlands.
With the next information, we would like to provide an overview to you and explain what this
project is about.

        <p class="generic"><b>Over 80 per cent of wastewater worldwide goes untreated.</b> As part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the international community committed to halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing its recycling and safe use globally by 2030. <b>Constructed wetlands can help!</b> </p>

        <p class="generic">Constructed wetlands can be <b>decentralised wastewater treatment</b> plants that are low-cost and low-maintenance. They <b>improve water quality</b> up to a level which is safe for use (e.g., for irrigation in agriculture) or for disposal to natural bodies of water. They provide biomass for the <b>production of bioenergy</b>. Moreover, they serve as a habitat for animals, or as a space for recreation and environmental education and research.</p>

        <p class="generic">However, closing wastewater data gaps and involving all necessary stakeholders are critical! There is little knowledge about the number and performance of existing constructed wetlands worldwide and their contribution to wastewater treatment. Many regions, especially in developing countries, face data scarcity. Where available, the existing data is unevenly distributed.</p>

        <p class="generic">That’s why researchers at UNU-FLORES have created a central online platform for constructed wetlands worldwide called <b>CWetlands – the Constructed Wetlands Knowledge Platform.</b> </p>

        <p class="generic">This demand-driven platform compiles data on constructed wetlands in two ways – firstly, the project team at UNU-FLORES systematically consolidates and curates them according to user needs and secondly, users may provide their own data through an online submission mechanism. Making information available on such a platform will foster research, policy development, and financing, and empower civil society organisations and practitioners to implement constructed wetlands for achieving sustainable development. </p>

          <div id="collapsible-4" class="collapse" class="btn btn-primary">
              <p class="generic">Globally, human and environmental health is endangered in many areas. In 2015, approx. <strong>2.4 billion
              people</strong> were still using unimproved sanitation facilities. Moreover, sources estimate that around
              <strong>80% of all wastewater worldwide</strong> is released untreated into the environment, leading to
              deteriorating water quality. The international community seeks to achieve <strong>universal access</strong> to
              adequate and equitable sanitation as well as to improve water quality by <strong>halving the proportion</strong> of
              untreated wastewater and increasing its safe reuse (targets 6.2 and 6.3 of the Agenda 2030).
              Constructed Wetlands (CWs) are nature-based solutions which can contribute to achieve the
              sustainable development goals, but it remains unclear to which extent, as, currently, there is no
              knowledge about the contribution of constructed wetland systems, e.g. to the global amount of
              treated wastewater. Moreover, several studies claimed limited data availability in the recent past.</p>
